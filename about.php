          <p style = "margin-top: 20px">The ancient Olympic Games were first held in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, and were dedicated to the Olympian gods. These Games were part of a religious festival in honor of Zeus, the king of the Greek gods. The Games continued for nearly 12 centuries until Emperor Theodosius I decreed in 393 AD that all such pagan festivals be banned.  The ancient Games initially included only a few events, such as the stadion , but over time, they expanded to include wrestling, boxing, chariot racing, and the pentathlon. Participation was initially restricted to freeborn Greek men, but later included athletes from various Greek city-states and colonies.
